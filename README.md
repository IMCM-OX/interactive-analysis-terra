# Interactive Analysis on Terra

This repository and associated files is meant for a toy demo for Interactive Analysis on Terra.Bio cloud platform.

NOTE: It DOES NOT cover nor teach how to methodically perform an analysis, but it acts as "cookbook" of best practices to ease your pain while working interactively on Terra; specifically:-

- Files/code organization.
- Data handling and organization.
- Associated output handling and archiving/storage.
- Version control and collaboration.

## Create analysis enviroment

Create a Virtual Machine (VM) to start your interactive analysis. Follow [these](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038125912-Your-interactive-analysis-VM-Cloud-Environment#h_01EWE22VY089T7SVA9J403CD48) instructions to get you there.

You can select one of the following common cloud environments (CE):-

- [Jupyter:](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/5075814468379-Starting-and-customizing-your-Jupyter-app) For analysis in Python programming language.
- [Rstudio:](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/5075722115227) For analysis in R statistical software.

They both come with a `terminal` for writing bash commands.

## Bring in your code from GitHub

NOTE: For a first time, it's recommended that you create a repository via [GitHub](https://github.com/), with a bare minimum of two files, the `README.md` and `.gitignore`. These are easily included once you enable the check-boxes during creation process.

The first step is to bring in code by using a Github Repository (such as this one IMCM-OX/interactive-analysis-terra).
Once you have your repository ready or if using an existing repository, `clone` the repository into your cloud environment in the VM. 

- Go to your GitHub repo, click on the green button labelled "Code", copy the `HTTPS` link.

There are two ways to proceed: 
In this demo we will be doing the first method by using Rstudio, instructions on how to do this can be found in this [confluence](https://oxgskimcm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TerraBio/pages/45514753/Working+with+Git+GitHub+on+terra) page or in this [blog post](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/version-control/4-getting-started-with-git-in-RStudio.html)

The second method, (if you are not using RStudio) is to clone your repository using the command line:-

- In the terminal, run the command `git clone <https_link>`

```bash
# clone your code repository into the CE
git clone https://github.com/IMCM-OX/interactive-analysis-terra.git

```
This pulls all your code and files from the remote repository into Terra CE and you can start editing/working on them immediately.

## Bring in your data from Terra Workspace

Once you have all codes/scripts in the C.E, next is to bring your data for analysis from a Terra workspace. For a better and reproducible structure, we recommend you create two sub-folders in your clone github folder directory:-

- **data:** This is the destination your raw data that you shall copy from a workspace
- **output:** This is the destination of any output (plot, pdf, processed data etc) emanating from your data analysis efforts.

In the application (RStudio or Jupyter), you can do this via terminal:

```bash
# create `data` folder if doesn't exist <in the current working directory>
mkdir data

# create `output` folder if doesn't exist <in the current working directory>
mkdir output

```

### OPTIONAL Advanced: This can be done programmatically like so in an R script:-

```bash
# create `data` folder if doesn't exist <in the current working directory>
if (!file.exists(xfun::relative_path("data"))){
  dir.create(xfun::relative_path("data"),
             recursive = TRUE)}

# create `output` folder if doesn't exist <in the current working directory>
if (!file.exists(xfun::relative_path("output"))){
  dir.create(xfun::relative_path("output"),
             recursive = TRUE)}

```

### IMPORTANT: Copy input data from another workspace

Use `gsutil` command line tools to copy the data from a Data Assets Workspace into the `data` sub-directory of your analysis workspace. 
You can find the `workspace_bucket` name in the cloud information section after clicking on any Terra workspace. 

```bash
# copy raw data into `data` subdirectory
gsutil cp -r `gs://workspace_bucket/path_to_terra_workspace` data/         # using comand line

# OPTIONAL Advanced: From an R script
system(command = "gsutil cp `gs://path_to_terra_workspace` data/")

```

## Perform your Analysis

Now you have your raw data inside `data` subfolder, it's time to import it into your software (python or R) and begin your analysis. All your data import commands shall point to `data/some_file.ext` or `data/data_sub_folder/some_file.ext`.

This is important in 3 ways:-

- Keeps your file paths consistent across all your scripts.
- Your whole analysis is reproducible in another VM/CE with the same set up; i.e. `data` subfolder for storing raw data
- Above all, collaboration becomes easy, no need to change file paths back and forth in the same script.

**`output`** subfolder:
Any analysis effort, processed data or plots and documents should be deposited in this folder. You can have expand the organization inside this folder to include further sub-folders as needed.


### About the analysis

This is a toy analysis for demo purposes using the `mtcars` and/or `iris` data sets from R to perform simple wrangling and visualization. The ideas can be expanded and be used to any kind of rectangular dataset i.e. flat file.

**Tasks:**
- Copy data from workspace
- Clean iris data by converting the columns (measurement in centimetres) into metres
- Create a simple scatter plot of `Sepal.Length` vs `Petal.Length`, color points by `Species`
- Create a multi-faceted histogram of all the columns colorued by `Species`
- Save/export the cleaned iris data back to the workspace under "processed" folder
- Save/export the two plots back to the workspace under "processed" folder


## IMPORTANT: Export your output to Terra Workspace

Once done with your analysis effort, it's time to start doing housekeeping. If you created files or analysis results inside the `output` folder and you need to store them in Terra for future sharing/use. The process is analagous to a previous step of copying raw data into our `data` subfolder using `gsutil` command line tools.

For the purposes of this demo we want to use an environment variable `$OWNER_EMAIL` so you and everyone else can see your own output in the shared workspace. Do this by adding '/$OWNER_EMAIL' to the end of your bucket path. Note that this is not commonly done outside of this demo within the IMCM. 

```bash
# copy files/products from `output` subdirectory to Terra workspace in the command line
gsutil cp -r output/some_file(s)  `gs://workspace_bucket/path_to_terra_workspace_sub_folder/$OWNER_EMAIL`      

# OPTIONAL Advanced: Programmatically from an R script
system(command = "gsutil cp  output/some_file(s)  `gs://path_to_terra_workspace/sub_folder/`")

```

This ensure that the files or data generated from an analysis that needs to be re-used later is safely stored in a respective Terra workspace and are not lost in the event we shut down the VM and delete the PD.

## Shut down the VM

Now, it's end of an analysis task. Your `output`s are safe in a Terra workspace and your codes are version-ed and pushed into GitHub, it's highly recommended you shut down your VM to avoid incurring costs.

While shutting down the VM, you can either:-

- Delete the VM and the PD (all generated files are lost, RECOMMENDED)
- Delete the VM and spare the PD (You loose the CE configuration, but you get to keep all the files in the PD)

## OPTIONAL ADVANCED: Push your code and scripts to GitHub

Your analysis output is safe in a Terra workspace, now it's time to give our `upadted` analysis code/script a safe home as well ðŸ™‚.
Note this step requires a github account. 

Do the following (usual git versioning workflow):

```bash
# stage the edited codes
git add .                                      # to stage all the edited scripts
git add R/script_name.R||python/script_name.py # to stage a specific script

# commit
git commit -m"descriptive_commit_message"     # commit the staged scripts

# push to github
git push origin <branch name>                 # push to GitHub your "new scripts"

```


### OPTIONAL: Using `.gitignore` files

Once you have the two subfolders, make sure you exclude them from your future GitHub commits by editing the `.gitigonre` file and specifying that they be excluded from a `commit` and `push`. You DO NOT want to commit/push data into GitHub, and this prevents that.

```bash
# put these lines in .gitignore file
data/
output/

```
