# Interactive Analysis on Terra

This repository and associated files is meant for a toy demo for Interactive Analysis on Terra.Bio cloud platform.

NOTE: It DOES NOT cover nor teach how methodically perform an analysis, but it acts as "cookbook" of best practices to easy your pain while working interactively on Terra; specifically

- Files/code organization
- Data handling and organization
- Associated output handling and archiving/storage.
- Version control and collaboration

## Create a VM

Create a Virtual Machine (VM) to start your interactive analysis. Follow [these](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360038125912-Your-interactive-analysis-VM-Cloud-Environment#h_01EWE22VY089T7SVA9J403CD48) instructions to get you there.

You can select one of the following common cloud environments:-

- [Jupyter:](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/5075814468379-Starting-and-customizing-your-Jupyter-app) For analysis in Python programming language.
- [Rstudio:](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/5075722115227) For analysis R statistical software.

They both come with a `terminal` for writing bash commands.
